# JavaScript Loose Equality Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in JavaScript stemming from the use of loose equality (==) instead of strict equality (===).  Loose equality can lead to unexpected type coercion, resulting in incorrect comparisons.

## The Bug
The `bug.js` file contains a function that uses loose equality to check for null values.  This approach can lead to false positives.

## The Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file shows the corrected code using strict equality (===), which prevents unintentional type coercion and ensures accurate null checks.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js`.  Observe the different outcomes for null and 0 inputs.

## Conclusion
Always use strict equality (===) in JavaScript to avoid unexpected behavior caused by loose equality.  Strict equality avoids type coercion and leads to more reliable and predictable code.
